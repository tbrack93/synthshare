This is a side project I've been working on to go through what we learned during
le wagon, the 9 week full stack web development course.

It is an homage to the Channel 4 series Humans, imagining a dystopian taskrabbit/
AirBnB style business in a world where people own Synths (intelligent robots).

It is very much a work in progress and a place for me to try out new features.
